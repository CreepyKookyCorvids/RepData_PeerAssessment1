Reproducable Research: Project 1

# Loading in the data

Loading the data is pretty simple using the `read.csv()` command below.

```{r}
stepsdata = read.csv('activity.csv')
```

# What is the mean number of steps taken per day?

By using the `na.rm` argument for the `mean` command, we can compute the mean easily:

```{r}
uniquedates = unique(stepsdata$date)

for (day in uniquedates) {
  daysteps = sum()
}
```
